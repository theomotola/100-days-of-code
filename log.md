### Day 1: December 27 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Hope to improve my previous knowledged as a front end developer and so i started working with JavaScript on freecodecamp

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
